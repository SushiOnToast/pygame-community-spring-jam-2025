# EchoSpace
### A submission for the Pygame Community Spring Jam 2025

EchoSpace is a suspenseful, atmospheric exploration game built around the concept of spatial awareness—through sound.
You play as a mysterious creature trapped in a pitch-black labyrinth. Vision is gone. Your only lifeline? A powerful echolocation pulse that briefly reveals the shape of your surroundings. But use it wisely—sound can save you, or betray you.
To escape, you must locate 3 hidden Resonance Cores scattered deep within the tunnels and return to the starting point to unlock your path to freedom.
But you’re not alone.

Strange beings lurk in the shadows. Some blind, drawn to your sound. Others silent, stalking in the dark. Survival depends on listening, planning, and mastering your voice.

Are you ready to echo through the void?
